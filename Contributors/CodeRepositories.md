#Code Repositories

We use GitHub for all code repositories. 


#Screencasts
Please be sure to use GitHub to create a Repository for each screencast. These repos will be the area where you commit and push your code samples for each screencast. Please share the links with Angela. 

#Courses
We use GitHub to hold all our courses code samples. Each course is given its own repository. Branches are used to organize the contents by  course lessons, this includes code samples, written content and handouts.
