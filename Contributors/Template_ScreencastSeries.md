## Screencast Process
If this is the first time you are creating screencasts for SitePoint then please note that once the initial outline has been confirmed, you will be required to send a sample video to Angela ([angela.molina@sitepoint.com](mailto:angela.molina@sitepoint.com)) via Digital Pigeon ([http://pigeon.to/1jWI5ao](http://pigeon.to/1jWI5ao)). 

Once the video has been reviewed, you may start working on your first screencast. You will be expected to send a video a week until your batch of videos have been completed. If you run into any trouble or delays in this process, please notify Angela or Ophelie ([ophelie@sitepoint](mailto:ophelie@sitepoint)) as soon as possible.

Happy planning!
