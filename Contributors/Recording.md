#Recording Guide
Great! You're ready to get your first video recorded. We've put together a little guide to help you get started.
##Microphones
Let's talk about equipment. 

When choosing a mircophone, we recommend getting a cardioid mic. This heart shaped microphone is developed in a way that focusses on the sound directly in-front instead of the sides, reducing the background sound.

Recommended entry microhones:

- [ATR2100](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2100-USB-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B004QJOZS4)
- [The Samson Q2U](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samson-Q2U-Microphone-HP20-Headphones/dp/B001R747SG)

Other recommended microphones:

- [Rode Podcaster](http://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster)
- [Blue Yeti](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-USB-Microphone/dp/B002VA464S)

We also recommend purchasing a [pop filter](http://www.amazon.com/Nady-MPF-6-6-Inch-Microphone-Filter/dp/B0002CZW0Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&ie=). This will help produce clearer sounds and minimise  heavy breathing, typing, pops and hisses.

##Video Editing
There are many video editing programs to choose from but this may change depending on your system. When choosing a video editor, make sure it allows the following:

- screencapture
- exports as a .mp3
- doesn't export with a watermark

Some notable programs include:

- [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html)
- [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)
- [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

##Recording set up
Preparing your recording space is equally important, it will either improve or decrease the quality of your sound. When recording look out for the following:

- tall ceilings
- lack of soft furnishing
- loud sounds (indoors and/or outdoors)
- tiled floor

The problem with the above is that it can cause the sound to bounce and echo when recording. To prevent this try and find a quiet room without too mucn interference from outside sounds from birds, traffic and pedestrians. 

The following help to increase sound quality:

- hanging curtains
- carpeted floors
- rugs
- couches

##Format
Please record your screencast at **1080p** (1920x1080) or **720p** (1280x720) and export as either a .mp4, .mov or .avi format.
