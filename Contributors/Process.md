#Process
Ready to follow the steps to creating your screencast?
##1. Pitch your idea
Introduce yourself, we don't bite and we are always looking for new contributors to join the SitePoint contributor community. We're a big happy family! 

##2. Setting Up
When getting ready to record we need to make sure you have your recording space and equipment set up correctly. The last thing we want is for you to record your screencast and then have to do it over again.

This means having the correct:

- microphone
- video editing program 
- recording space set up
- video format

You can get more information about recording equipment in our [Recording Guide](https://github.com/learnable-content/contributor-documentation/blob/master/Contributors/Recording.md)
##3. Send us a Video Sample
To make sure that you have everything set up correctly, please create a 20 - 30 second sample video and send it our way. We collect videos through [Digital Pigeon](http://bit.ly/1K52UGY).

##4. Create Your Code Sample
We like to keep all code samples in the one spot. Once you're ready to start creating code samples, we will set you up with a GitHub repository.

##5. Send Us Your Final Screencast
We're looking at the tail-end of the production process. Once again, you can send us your completed video through Digital Pigeon.

##6. Invoice Us
Once your screencast has been published, you can send us an invoice. Check the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/5Pn9GZZR/sitepoint-short-videos) production board to see when your screencast is scheduled to go.
