#Quizzes
Every course has a quiz available between every couple of lessons to help consolidate the learning. This means if a course is made up of 5 lessons; lesson 2 and 4 will most likely have a quiz.

##Tell me more...
We create course quizzes for you using Sit the Test system. What we need from you, are the questions. Once we have your quizzes, you can sit back and relax as your course is only one step closer to completion.
