#Handouts
We understand that people need to read or print content especially when on the run. That's why for every course we make, we also provide handouts. Who creates the handouts you may ask? **We do!**

Every video created as part of your course has transcripts made. From these transcripts our Course Assistants dive in and create handouts formatted in an easy to read and comprehensible manner. They're also available in both a pdf and .md format. 


#What do we need from you
Nothing. We do all of this for you.
