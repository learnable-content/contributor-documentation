#Screencast Repositories

We use GitHub for all screencasts code samples. All contributors will be provided with their own repository. For every screencast containing code samples, a branch should be made. 

All branches in a contributor repo should contain the code needed for a screencast. The branch should be labelled in a way that makes it clear which screencast it's contributing towards.

An example of this can be see with Ashraff's screencast repository.

Each screencast created by Ashraff has a new branch made that contains the screencast sample code. They're labelled clearly so they can easily identify which screencast the branch relates to.

The contents of the screencast has a .md file with a brief description of the branch contents. It also contains the code sample for the screencast.
