#Pitch us
Introduce yourself, we don't bite and we are always looking for new contributors to join the SitePoint contributor community. We're a big happy family! 

Now that you want to join, tell us about yourself. What have you worked with in development, and how would you like to contribute to the site? Pitch us your ideas! What is something new you've discovered and would love to show to the world? What is something you could teach?

We have a [screencast outline](https://github.com/learnable-content/contributor-documentation/tree/master/Contributors/Template_ScreencastSeries.md) for you to complete. Once it's completed, send it through to Angela - angela.molina@sitepoint.com.
