#Video Tutorials
##What are they?
We’re currently commissioning focussed, bite-sized videos. These short videos (between 7 and 12 minutes each) will show viewers how to solve a problem, use a tool, or build something as you work. 

The inspiration for these informal videos is something you’ve likely experienced: the ease with which we learn when a friend or coworker sits down with us and teaches us how to do something. 

**Need a couple of examples?** Here’s a video by [Joseph Lowery on Composer](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/screencasts/php-dependencies-made-easy-with-composer), and one by [Russ Weakley on Responsive Background Videos](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/screencasts/web-elements-with-responsive-background-videos).  

##Series
Series are a compilation of video tutorials that will help you learn as many things as possible within a topic; a playlist. If you have a video tutorial idea that would fit perfectly into a series, we want to know about it! Let's get it done.

 If you would like to develop a set of videos about a topic, you'll need to first develop a [video tutorial series outline](https://github.com/learnable-content/contributor-documentation/blob/master/Contributors/Screencasts.md) to pitch your idea.
