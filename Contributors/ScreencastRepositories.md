#Screencast Repositories

We use GitHub for all screencasts code samples. All contributors will be provided with their own repository. For every screencast containing code samples, a branch should be made. 

All branches in a contributor repo should contain the code needed for a screencast. The branch should be labelled in a way that makes it clear which screencast it's contributing towards.

An example of this can be see with Ashraff's screencast repository.
