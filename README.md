# Contributor Documentation
A place for all information for contributor, teaching assistants and course helpers. If you have a question about the process involved in any area within SitePoint Premium, you'll find it here.

This is a work in progress, so feel free to jump in and make suggestions or even better pull requests. 

Thanks,

Angela and the SitePoint team.
