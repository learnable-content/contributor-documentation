#Role as a Teaching Assistant
**Congratulations, you're a Teaching Assistant!**

Well the first thing you may be wondering is what exactly you have to do as a TA. As a TA, you're joining a small group of people who are also as committed and passionate about the web and helping others. 

As a TA you are required to engage with the Premium community and answer any questions they may have and post on our content discussion area. 

You will be assigned to content (books, screencasts or courses) in your area of expertise. If a user has a question regarding the content to which you have been assigned, you will be pinged. Once you have a user discussion pending, we ask that you respond to the discussion within a 24 hour period. We know that there are timezone issues that exist and may delay a response, but as soon as you can, please respond.

We also have a Slack group for our TA's, any group notifications will be posted there. You can also use it as a way to reach out to other TA's if assistance is needed. 

The next few documents will show you the ropes.
