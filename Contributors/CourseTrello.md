#Trello for Courses
As mentioned with screencasts, we like having our production process information available for all parties involved. 

How? Trello. We keep track of our process on Trello.

As soon as your course has been confirmed and contracted, a Trello board will be made for your course.

##I see my board but what does it mean?
A course board is made up of different columns. Each column represents a new stage in the production process. 

The steps you should see will include:

###- Resources
	- Each assets/lesson in a course is represented by a card. All information regarding the asset is available within the card. You can move cards to different sections to display where in the production process that card is currently found.
