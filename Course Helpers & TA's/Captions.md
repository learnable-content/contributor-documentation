# How to Edit and Submit Video Captions

As part of the work on SitePoint Premium courses, the individual screencast videos are sent off to a service to be captioned. Those videos, and the captions, are then returned to us, and the option is there for us to wtch them, and to edit the captions ourselves.

## How Cielo 24 Works

Cielo 24 is a service that allows us to view each video alongside its returned captions. In the SitePoint Cielo24 Portfolio, you can see a list of all of the caption jobs that have recently been submitted or completed.

Each set of captions is broken into lines (sentences, typically) and all of the captions are searchable, as well. As the video is played within the editor, you can see the caption line center screen, stop the video, edit it, and save your changes in a very intuitive manner.

## Editing Captions

To edit a caption, either allow the video to play to the line which you are interested in editing, or, to speed the process you may skip through lines on the navigation panel on the left side of the screen.
