#Trello for Courses
As mentioned with screencasts, we like having our production process information available for all parties involved. 

How? Trello. We keep track of our process on Trello.

As soon as your course has been confirmed and contracted, a Trello board will be made for your course.

#I see my board but what does it mean?
##Cards
Each assets/lesson in a course is represented by a card. All information regarding the asset is available within the card. You can move cards to different sections to display where in the production process that card is currently found.

##Columns
A course board is made up of different columns. Each column represents a new stage in the production process. 

The steps you should see will include:

###- Resources
Each assets/lesson in a course is represented by a card. All information regarding the asset is available within the card. You can move cards to different sections to display where in the production process that card is currently found.

This column will have some pre-made cards available. These cards will hold information regarding the course and contributor making the course (you).

###- Assets in creation
All cards in this colum mean that the lesson code samples (in GitHub) and/or slides are currently being created.

###- Assets created
Cards in this column have completed slides and code samples and now ready for its first review.

###- Code sample in GitHub
Every course has it's own GitHub repositories. These repositories will hold all code samples (and handouts) for a course. For more information on the way your course code samples are organised, have a read of [Course repositories] **add link here**

###- Code and slide review
All the assets for the course (code, repo and slides) are now being technically reviewed. All feedback can be found linked to from the **Technical Review: Round 1** card.

###- Ready to film
Cards in this column have gone through their first technical review, feedback has been presented to their contributor (you) and is now ready for the next stage, video recording.

###- Videos in progress
As each lesson is recorded, a new card is brought over to this column.

###- Video recorded
The video has been recorded, edited and now sent to the team via Digital Pigeon.

###- Video in builder
All videos that have been sent and placed into the course builder are listed in this column.

###- Tech edit
Once all videos in a course has been set up into a course, it is ready to be technically reviewed again. This time your entire code repository, slides and videos will be reviewed.

###- Tech edit completed
Hurray! Your review has been completed. You'll receive all your feedback in the **Technical Review: Round 2** card.

###- Teacher edits
_If_ you need to make changes from the review feedback, then those lessons that require changes are listed here.

###- Quiz created
Whilst your course was being reviewed, you should have had time to work on creating quiz questions. Once your questions have been created you can attach your quiz questions to the **Quiz Questions** card found in the Resources column. Drag this card over to this **Quiz created** column and ping me into the card. I'll then get cracking and create your quizzes.

###- Quiz completed
Once the quiz has been created and linked to the course, the **Quiz created** card will be found in this column.

###- In final edit
From here on out, I will be working with the Course Helpers to get your course ready for publishing. Cards in **In final edit** are currently being edited (slightly) for publishing.

###- Set up in builder
All cards in this column have been edited and exported for publishing. This means they're in the course builder.

###- Video poster in progress
Our Course Helpers will be creating course posters for each lesson (video) in your course. Cards in this area are currently having their posters made.

###- Video poster done and ready for builder
Well posters have been made for the video and now placed in the builder

###- Videos in builder confirmed
I'll get you to have a look over your course to make sure it's A-OK.

###- Captions in progress
All cards in this column have been sent off for captioning and will be reviewed. Feel free to sit back and relax, our Course Helpers are handling this stuff.

###- Captions done and in the builder
Captions have been made, reviewed and now in the builder. Next step, chapter markers.

###- Chapter marker in progress
Our Course Helpers are working to create chapter markers for your videos. **What are they?** They're video bookmarks that allow viewers to skip to different "segments" in your video. 

Once again, nothing you need to do here.

###- Chapter marker done and in the builder
Our brilliant Course Helpers have made chapter markers for your video and placed them in the builder.

###- Handout images in progress
Handouts will be made for your course but we need to create some banner images for these handouts. Cards in this column means one of our Course Helpers is currently working on that for you.

###- Handout images done
Handout images are ready. Now, to create the handouts.

###- Handouts in progress
A handout isn't complete without content. This is what one of our Course Helpers is currentl working on. They'll be reviewing your content, transcripts and packaging it into a pretty neat handout; one per video.

###- Handouts in GitHub
Once the handouts are complete, they'll be stored in your GitHub repository, along with your code.

###- Ready to launch
Done! It's ready to go but just waiting on one thing, the publishing date. I'll let you know when that is. 

###- Launched!
**It's live!!!** Now feel free to boast about it online. I mean, why not, _you_ made it!

###- Course added to Onsist
No one likes stealing, especially when it's your work. We'll make sure that doesn't happen. When a card is in this area, I've done just that.

###- Promotional video created
One last thing, we need to promote your video. As one of the videos that needed to be created, you should have worked on picking a lesson from your course you'd like to use a promotional video. When you see a card in this column, I've started editing your promotional video (if needed). 

Please provide some copy for the promotional video, this will be used as the SitePoint article text. Have a read of [Additional Videos](https://github.com/learnable-content/contributor-documentation/blob/master/Contributors/Additional-Videos.md) for more information.
