#Slack
As a contributor, we consider you as a member of the SitePoint family. 

We have a SitePoint team on Slack to help connect you to other contributors and be a member of our large SitePoint community. You'll find other video contributors, article authors, publishers, forum regulars as well as the SitePoint team. 

Feel free to jump into any conversation and connect with any other member.

If you are working on screencast, you'll be invited to join the *short-videos* private group.

See you there!
