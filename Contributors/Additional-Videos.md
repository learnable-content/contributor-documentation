#Additional Videos
Yes, there are a couple of other videos we need from you aside from the course videos. They are:

- Sales Video
- Introduction
- Conclusion
- Promotional snippets

##What are these videos?
###Sales
This is an quick 40 second video that introduces and slightly pitches the course prior to a student enrolling into the course. This is where you tell them what this course is about, how it will run and what they will learn. It should be casual and informative, and try to avoid making it sounding like a sales pitch.

An example of a good Sales video is - 

###Introduction
The student has enrolled, now you can welcome them to the course and give them any further details they may need prior to starting.

###Conclusion
Your student has finished your course, that's great! Run through a quick summary of what they've learnt and congratulate them.

###Promotional snippets
This video goes out for publishing outside of SitePoint Premium.

We ask you to pick one awesome lesson from your course (the second or third best lesson). We will edit this video as an individual video and use it for promotional publishing. 

What we need from you is: 

- one 10 second video snippet introducing the lesson, what you'll learn in this video and why it's awesome. 
- another 5 - 10 second video thanking the viewer for watching and also mentioning that this is one video from your latest course [enter course name] on SitePoint Premium.

Bundle that up for me and I'll get it ready for publishing and promoting.
