#Creating Slides

All courses and screencasts at SitePoint need to be aligned with our style guide in order to maintain consistency. 
In the following you will find assets and templates you can utilize to keep a consistent design on your slides.
Note: We are using "Helvetica" as the standard font for all of our slides.
