# Contributor Documentation
A place for all information for contributor, teaching assistants and course helpers. If you have a question about the process involved in any area within SitePoint Premium, you'll find it here.

This is a work in progress, so feel free to jump in and make suggestions or even better pull requests. 

Thanks,

**[Angela and the SitePoint team](https://github.com/learnable-content/contributor-documentation/blob/master/Contributors/Who-are-we.md)**
