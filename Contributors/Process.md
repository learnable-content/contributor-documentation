#Process
Ready to follow the steps to creating your screencast?
##1. Pitch your idea
Introduce yourself, we don't bite and we are always looking for new contributors to join the SitePoint contributor community. We're a big happy family! 

Now that you want to join, tell us about yourself. What have you worked with in development, and how would you like to contribute to the site? Pitch us your ideas! What is something new you've discovered and would love to show to the world? What is something you could teach?

We have a screencast outline for you to complete. Once it's completed send it through to Angela - angela.molina@sitepoint.com. 

##2. Setting up
When getting ready to record we need to make sure you have your recording space and equipment set up correctly. The last thing we want is for you to record your screencast and then have to do it over again.

This means having the correct:

- Microphone
- Video editing program 
- Recording space set up
- Video format
 
###Microphones
It's time to get your equipment set up. When choosing a mircophone, we recommend getting a cardioid mic. This heart shaped microphone is developed in a way that focusses on the sound directly in-front instead of the sides, reducing the background sound.

Recommended entry microhones:

- [ATR2100](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2100-USB-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B004QJOZS4)
- [The Samson Q2U](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samson-Q2U-Microphone-HP20-Headphones/dp/B001R747SG)

Other Recommended microphones:

- [Rode Podcaster](http://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster)
- [Blue Yeti](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-USB-Microphone/dp/B002VA464S)

We also recommend that when recording sound, to invest in a [pop filter](http://www.amazon.com/Nady-MPF-6-6-Inch-Microphone-Filter/dp/B0002CZW0Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&ie=). This will help produce clearer sounds and minimise the sound of heavy breathing, typing, strongly pronounced p's, f's and s's.

###Video Editing
There are many video editing programs that exist, some available depending on your system. When choosing a video editor, make sure it allows the following:

- screencapture
- exports as a .mp3
- doesn't export with a watermark

Some notable programs include:

- [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html)
- [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)
- [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

###Recording set up
Preparing your recording space is equally important, it will either improve or decrease the quality of your sound. When recording look out for the following:

- tall ceilings
- lack of soft furnishing
- loud sounds (indoor and outdoor)
- tiled floor

The problem with the above is that it can cause the sound to bounce and echo when recording. To prevent this try and find a quiet room without too mucn interference from outside sounds from birds, traffic and pedestrians. 

The following help to increase sound quality:

- hanging curtains
- carpeted floors
- rugs
- couches

###Format
Please record your screencast at 1080p (1920x1080) or 720p (1280x720) and export as .mp4, .mov or .avi.

##3. Send us a video sample
To make sure that you have everything set up correctly, please create a 20 - 30 second sample video and send it our way. Once done, please send it to us through [Digital Pigeon](http://bit.ly/1K52UGY).

##4. Create your code sample
Once your pitch idea has been approved we'll set you up with a GitHub repository for your course or screencast series.

##5. Send us your final screencast
You're almost done, and this step is the same as 3. 

##6. Invoice us
Once your screencast has been published, you can send us an invoice. How do you know it's been published? Track your screencast on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/5Pn9GZZR/sitepoint-short-videos).
