# Trello for Screencasts

SitePoint uses Trello for many purposes. One board is used for tracking screencast videos from inception to published status. The board used to track these videos is [https://trello.com/b/5Pn9GZZR/sitepoint-short-videos](https://trello.com/b/5Pn9GZZR/sitepoint-short-videos). You'll need to be invited to the board. Here's a quick overview of the process.

## Organizational Boards

There are several lists of a more organizational type. Topics up for grabs, Collections, and Contributors. Contributors is a list of the contributors who contribute screencasts. Each of them has their own card.

## Videos

Cards for videos begin to really matter for Course Helper work when they arrive in the Up Next list. There, the screencast is taking shape, the description may be added (and may not yet). Once the cards are Ready for Edit, they are ready to have the videos sent off for captioning, images made, and repositories created for any code samples they require. Typically, the cards are a place for SitePoint staff and the contributors to interact. When a task requires actions from a course helper, they will usually be tagged with an @mention. 

## Post Production

Finally, videos arrive in post production. Here, much as in the other lists, @mentioned course helpers will review captions, and upload screencast images, posters, and captions to videos on SitePoint's admin area. Additionally, course helpers can also be asked to enhance descriptions for videos, or in some cases, write them entirely.

## Ready to Launch and Live

When videos are ready to launch, or are already live, there may be minor adjustments to the captions, descriptions, images, etc. This will usually be the same actions as already taken.
