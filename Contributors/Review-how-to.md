#Technical Review
If you have been asked to provide a technical review, this page is for you.

##What am I Reviewing?
You are going to be asked to review the content provided to you. This could mean either of a couple of different things, depending on which round of reviews you're conducting:

- Round 1: You'll be reviewing code samples, slides and written content.
- Round 2: This is the final review. You'll be reviewing code samples, slides, written content, and videos.

##What Am I Looking For?
- Technical errors
- Technical best practices
- Spelling and grammatical mistakes

If you are doing a second round technical review, and have videos available, you'll be watching and following the course from start to end and documenting any feedback.

##How-To
###Content
You will be given access to the requisite GitHub repository, as well as a Feedback document.

You'll be asked to review the content and code provided within GitHub. Please make a pull request of the repository, and leave a comment for any content you see that needs feedback.

###Video
If you're completing a final review, you'll also be given access to the actual course link.

When reviewing the videos, use the feedback document provided, and make a note of the video lesson and timestamp when writting your feedback items.
