#Course Process

##1. Pitch your idea
You would've worked with us on screencasts and ready to work on a course. Great! What's your course idea? Let us know, and if we like it we'll ask you to create a course outline. 

##2. Course outline
We want to see how your idea translates into a course. Please complete an outline and make it as descriptive as you can. An outline includes a description of the course, a course syllabus breaking down the lessons and steps per lesson. 

We will provide you with a document to use. Once your outline is complete and approved, we will develop a course contract.

*Note:* Each step represents a video. 

##2. Create your code sample
We like to keep all code samples in the one spot. Once you're ready to start creating code samples, we will set you up with a GitHub repository for your course. 

This repository is set up differently to screencasts, please make sure you're familiar with the way we arrange our course code samples.

##3. Create slides
If you need slides created for your course, we can arrange to have them made. Send over a copy of your slides with a simple layout; black text on a white background. 

##4. Code and slide review
Once your slides and code samples have been created they will be sent off for it's first (of two) reviews. This technical review will look for missed errors, and early findings that will improve the quality of your course including improved code and content following best practice.

This process takes a week. Once completed, any feedback received will be forwarded back to you. We would like for you to take the feedback onboard and make changes where needed.

##5. Create your videos
Now that you have your feedback and we have discussed the changes needed (if any), you can start recording your videos. 

As always send the videos through Digital Pigeon. Once all the videos have been sent, they will be packaged and sent for its final review. 

##6. Final review
This review helps to make sure that the overall course is complete without any errors and ready for publishing. This includes slides, code samples and video content.  

There is a one week turn-around for this process.

##7. Create your quiz questions
Whilst your course is going through its final review, it's a perfect time to start working on quiz questions. 

We ask that you create 5 questions for approximately every second course lesson â€” this changes on the course structure. 

The questions are generally made up of true or false; or multiple choice questions. 

##6. Invoice us
Congratulations, your course has been published! You can now send us an invoice for the agreed amount.
