# Trello for TAs

SitePoint uses Trello for many purposes. One board is used for keeping track of which courses, books, and screencasts are assigned to which Teaching Assistants. The board used to track these lists is [https://trello.com/b/rRYgj09P/teaching-assistants](https://trello.com/b/rRYgj09P/teaching-assistants). You'll need to be invited to the board. Here's a quick overview of the process.

## Upcoming Courses and Books

This list presents a list of all upcoming courses and books, and typically each card just contains the title, or at most, a description, of the course. If the course is not assigned to a TA yet, a TA can assign themselves by opening the card, then under "Add" clicking "Members" and then adding themselves to the card, possibly with a comment as well.

## Courses, Books and Collections Not Yet Assigned a TA

This list is for items that are now live, but have not yet been assigned a TA. If a TA does not choose them, they will most often be assigned to a TA at this point anyway, as we do not wish to have courses and books that have no one following them!

## The TA Lists

The remaining lists are simply one list per Teaching Assistant, with all of the cards for courses and books that they are responsible for. So, when conversations are begun, whoever is notifying TAs can check the board if they aren't sure, do a quick search for the card for the course in question, and see which list it is in - and thus which TA to notify of the conversation.
