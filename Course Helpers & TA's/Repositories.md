##How to create a screencast repository

#### Creating the repository
Go to the SitePoint Premium repository on Github â€” https://github.com/learnable-content. You may need permission to create the repository, if this is the case contact Angela. *Note:  if you are creating the Github repository from scratch then name it with the persons name or Collection name (i.e. Hathy-screencasts or RSpec-collection)*

* Initialize the Repo by the Github.com, commandline or Git application (i.e. Source Tree)
* **Create a Readme.md for Master Branch**
  Use a text editor or the editor from Github to create the readme.md. ( Note. All readme's or text at Github will use Markdown so make sure you are familiar  with Markdown (https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

  After the Readme is created and you have committed it to the repo it will show on Github like this.

#### Create your first branch

How to create a branch is fairly easy you can use the commandline, Github.com or even a Git application to do this.

At Github.com you first want to click on Branch:Master button (it will be a dropdown)

After clicking on Branch: Master button a dropdown like this will appear.

#### What goes into the branch
After you have the branch created each screencast will have just code samples that the author will provide. *Angela will  provide a link to the author's repo where you can download or fork the repo to get the code samples.* These files will be  uploaded/commited to the SitePoint Premium screencast repo.



and that's how you create a screencast repo!
