# Teaching Assistant Conversations

The key duty of Teaching Assistants is to handle discussions that come up on courses, screencasts, and books on SitePoint Premium.

## The Process
As a Teaching Assistant, you will be assigned to various Premium content, using the [Trello board for TA's](https://github.com/learnable-content/contributor-documentation/blob/master/Course%20Helpers%20&%20TA's/Trello_for_TAs.md). On that board, you will have a list dedicated to your TA responsibilities. Within that list will be a card for every piece of Premium content that you are responsible for. This is so that both you and the others involved with TA activities will be aware of who is involved with which content.

When a new conversation is posted in response to a piece of content that is your responsibility, you will be notified via email, or via the teaching assistants channel on Slack.

## Responding to Conversations
When responding to a conversation, it is important to keep a few things in mind.

### Knowledge and Answers
One of the most important things is to actually answer the question and leave the asker satisfied, whether they are issuing a complaint, asking for clarification, or needing help completing a course. If you do not have the knowledge required in the specific topic, either find the person an answer, or else get in touch with Angela or the course author to get them the resources they need. 

### Tone and Engagement
Make sure that the tone of the answers is friendly and appropriate. Do not be rude or condescending, but focus on sounding helpful. Engage people - feel free to ask about how they are doing with the rest of the course, if they have any programming background or are new to it, if they have any suggestions, et cetera. Engaging with Premium users on more than just a direct answer to help requests is definitely encouraged.

## Followup
It never hurts to keep an eye on a conversation, especially if it has involved some back-and-forth. You might see a reply before you get a notification of it. Also, make sure to record your time, and [track it using Freshbooks](https://github.com/learnable-content/contributor-documentation/blob/master/Course%20Helpers%20%26%20TA's/Timingtasks.md).
