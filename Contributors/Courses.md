#Courses
##What are They?
Courses are a complete series of videos designed to comprehensively teach a viewer the ins and outs of a subject matter within a 2 - 2.5 hour duration.

The lessons are designed to teach from both a theoretical and practical perspective. This means that many courses have either many smaller examples demonstrating the lessons of a video, or allow the viewer to progressively work through a single more extensive project demonstrating the same.

Aside from videos, all courses also include: handouts, captions, interactive transcripts, code samples, and quizzes. We ask that you create the videos, code samples, and provide quesitons for the quiz.

##Certificate of Completion
We also provide members with the opportunity to download a Certificate of Completion. We think it looks pretty special when the certificate comes from the course teacher. If you would like your course certificates branded with your name, you can send us a copy of  your signature that we will digitise. 

*Note:* The signature doesn't have to be your real signature, in fact we *recommend* that it's not.
